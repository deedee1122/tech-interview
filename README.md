# Technologies used ->

- Bootstrap -> to quickly create a responsive website plus to quickly add ready made componnets from the bootstrap library.
- React -> to create a frontend application and to manage our features/components.
- React-router-dom -> to create a routing system for different pages of our application.
- Axios -> to pull data from the Provided API
-

# Sugestions for improvements :

- .env -> we're gonna use a .env file to store all of our authentication passwords and other sensitive information.
- redux toolkit -> TO manage all data in a single file and to make it easier to manage.
- storybook -> we're gonna use this tool to make reusable components
- JEST -> we're gonna use this tool to test our code so that it works properly as expected

- we can include a filter component on left side of the cards so that users can filter the cards by tags.
- We can include a pagination feature by installing a package called react-paginate to display the pagination. It will handle all the data coming from the API in pages.
